##### !question

Write a program that allows a user to play a guessing number game. Your program should generate a random number between 0 â€“ 1000 (including 0, but not including 1000). Allow the user to make a guess until they guess the answer. After each guess you should print "higher" or "lower". When they guess it correctly print a winning message along with their total number of guesses.

You can do this with a while loop.

```ruby
number = rand(0...1000)
num_guesses = 1
puts "Guess my number: "
guess = gets.chomp.to_i

while number != guess
  if number < guess
    puts "LOWER"
  else
    puts "HIGHER"
  end

  num_guesses += 1
  guess = gets.chomp_to_i
end

puts "YOU GOT IT IN #{num_guesses} GUESSES!"
```
