##### !question

Write a program that allows a user to play a guessing number game. Your program should generate a random number between 0 â€“ 1000 (including 0, but not including 1000). Allow the user to make a guess until they guess the answer. After each guess you should print "higher" or "lower". When they guess it correctly print a winning message along with their total number of guesses.
