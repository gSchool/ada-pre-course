# Pre-Ada Course

Welcome to this Pre-Ada Course.  This course is required prior to attending Ada Developers Academy as a student.  

The purpose of this re-Ada course is to keep you coding (and talking about code) between admissions and the first day of class. Understand the topics covered in the JumpStart and JumpStart Live curriculum and practice this understanding with the assignments provided. Take this opportunity to meet and study with peers in your cohort.  You will have been invited to the Cohort Slack, and we will set up a channel to discuss the course and coding challenges.  **Take advantage of it.**

All admitted students are expected to be well-versed with the concepts covered in the Jump Start curriculum on the first day of their cohort. This includes conditional flows, loops, arrays, hashes and Ruby basics. As such, you are expected to complete all exercises in the JumpStart curriculum.  

As you complete each assignment you will recieve feedback, some of which is automated and others are not.  This is our first time using the Learn platform from [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/), and as such there will be bumps in the process.  Please be patient with bugs and let us know on Slack, so we can fix them. 

Some exercises here are multiple choice, some ask you to write code into a coding window, while others ask you to submit a link to your solution.  Most of the exercises here have tests to automatically tell you if you solved it or not.  Others require an instructor to review your code.  Be patient and we will try to deliver feedback as promptly as possible.

## Days

The course is designed with days to match the 6-day in-person Pre-Ada sessions for students determined to need a bit of additional support called Jump Start Live.  If you want to attend Jump Start Live sessions, you can request to do so, but space is limited and admission is based on need.

## Learning Goals for the Course

In this course we want you to learn to do the following:

*  Consistently follow [Ruby style practices](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide)
*  Understand the of order of operations reflected in use of relational and logical operators
*  Understand and use complex conditional statements
*  Understand and use iterators and loops
*  Understand and use arrays along with loops
*  Understand and use hashes along with loops
*  Understand and use arrays and hashes together - nested data structures with loops

We also want you to learn a bit of workflow and learn to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write your programs.

## Learning HTML & CSS 

Beyond this course, we also want you to take the free [Udacity HTML & CSS](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001)  course in preparation for our HTML/CSS unit.

## Today's Lesson

Today's lesson is about workflow, Ruby style and basic types and operations.  This should feel like review and give you a smooth start.  Try to work through things a bit at a time and feel free to walk away for a bit when you are stuck, or shout out for support on Slack.  

We'll let you get started...
