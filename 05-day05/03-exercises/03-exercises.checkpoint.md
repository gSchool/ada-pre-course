# Exercises

1. Create an array to store 5 names. Have the user enter in the 5 names and then print out the 5 names in all UPPERCASE all on the same line. Note that the user may not enter all the names in uppercase.
1. Create an array to store 3 boolean values entered in by the user. Print out YES if all the values are true and NO if at least one value is false. _Hint: Prompt the user to enter `true` or `false`, and accept those values using `gets`. Since `gets` will give us back a string (instead of the boolean values we want) use if statements to convert those strings to boolean values._
1. Create an array to store the following words: firetruck, fire drill, fire hydrant, firefighter, fireproof, fire station, fire hose. Then write code that uses the array to print out `truck, drill, hydrant, fighter, proof, station, hose` without modifying the array.
1. Create an array to store the amount of money spent on 4 people during the Holidays. Have the user enter in the amount spent on each person. Print the total spent on all the people. Total money spent should be displayed with a dollar sign, decimal point, and only 2 digits after the decimal.

1. Create an array to store 5000 decimal numbers. Randomly generate numbers from between 0 â€“ 1 (including 0, but not including 1) to fill the array. Calculate and print the mean of all the elements in the array.
