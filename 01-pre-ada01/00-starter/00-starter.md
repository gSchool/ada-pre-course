# Getting Started & The Pre-Ada Units

Welcome to this the Ada Course.  This course, through the Learn Learning Management System is how we will teach you at Ada.  The first units are Pre-Ada units you will need to complete prior to starting at Ada.  

The purpose of the Pre-Ada unit is to keep you coding (and talking about code) between admissions and the first day of class. You should understand the topics covered in the JumpStart and JumpStart Live curriculum and practice this understanding with the assignments provided. Take this opportunity to meet and study with peers in your cohort.  You will have been invited to the Cohort Slack, and we will set up a channel to discuss the course and coding challenges.  **Take advantage of it.**

All admitted students are expected to be well-versed with the concepts covered in the Jump Start curriculum on the first day of their cohort. This includes conditional flows, loops, arrays, hashes and Ruby basics. As such, you are expected to complete all exercises in the JumpStart curriculum.  

As you complete each assignment you will recieve feedback, some of which is automated and others are not.  This is our first time using the Learn platform from [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/), and as such there will be bumps in the process.  **Please be patient with bugs and let us know on Slack, so we can fix them.**

Some exercises here are multiple choice, some ask you to write code into a coding window, while others ask you to submit a link to your solution.  Many of the exercises here have tests to automatically tell you if you solved it or not.  Others require an instructor to review your code.  Be patient and we will try to deliver feedback as promptly as possible.

## You can resubmit

In this course you can always resubmit work.  If you want a 2nd-round of instructor feedback let us know on Slack as we normally only give feedback once.

## Due Dates

* You are expected to complete Units 1-3, Getting Started through Arrays, Loops and Boolean Zen by **August 11th**
* You are expected to complete the entire course on Monday August 24th to attend Ada Cohort 14.

## Pre-Ada Units

These units are designed with units to match the 6-day in-person Pre-Ada sessions for students determined to need a bit of additional support called Jump Start Live.  If you want to attend Jump Start Live sessions, you can request to do so, but space is limited and admission is based on need.

## Learning Goals prior to starting at Ada

In this course we want you to learn to do the following:

*  Consistently follow [Ruby style practices](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide)
*  Understand the of order of operations reflected in use of relational and logical operators
*  Understand and use complex conditional statements
*  Understand and use iterators and loops
*  Understand and use arrays along with loops
*  Understand and use hashes along with loops
*  Understand and use arrays and hashes together - nested data structures with loops
*  Learn HTML & CSS

We also want you to learn a bit of workflow and learn to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write your programs.

## Your Pre-Ada Responsibilities

* Complete Units 1-6 of the Pre-Ada Material
* Complete an [HTML/CSS Udacity Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001), it's free
* Complete the Social Justice Content

## Coding Exercises

### Tested Code Snippets

As you proceed through this course you will be asked to complete a variety of coding challenges.  Put your code into the text areas provided and when you submit the exercise many will be automatically tested and provide you feedback.  Try the exercise below.

<!-- >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> BEGIN CHALLENGE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> -->
<!-- Replace everything in square brackets [] and remove brackets  -->

### !challenge

* id: bb3f699b-e1cb-466c-a1f3-b5efa7cf4ffd
* title: Hello world
* docker_directory_path: /custom-snippets/hello-world
<!-- * points: [1] (optional, the number of points for scoring as a checkpoint) -->
<!-- * topics: [python, pandas] (optional the topics for analyzing points) -->

##### !question

Write a program which prints "Hello, World!"

##### !end-question

##### !explanation

A solution could be:  

```ruby
puts "Hello, World!"
```

##### !end-explanation

### !end-challenge

<!-- ======================= END CHALLENGE ======================= -->

### Links to Code

Other programming exercises called Project Challenges will ask you to submit a link to code either in [repl.it](https://repl.it), [Gist](https://gist.github.com) or a [github repository](https://github.com/).

<!-- >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> BEGIN CHALLENGE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> -->
<!-- Replace everything in square brackets [] and remove brackets  -->

* title: Example Project Challenge
* points: 1
* topics: example

##### !question

Create a Hello World Application on [Repl.it](https://repl.it), [Gist](https://gist.github.com) or a [github repository](https://github.com/) and submit a link to your submission.

##### !end-question

Place your link here

##### !end-placeholder

<!-- other optional sections -->
##### !hint 

You can learn [how to create a gist](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists), or just create a program on [repl.it](https://repl.it).

## Learning HTML & CSS 

Beyond this course, we also want you to take the free [Udacity HTML & CSS](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001)  course in preparation for our HTML/CSS unit.

## This Lesson

This lesson is about workflow, Ruby style and basic types and operations.  This should feel like review and give you a smooth start.  Try to work through things a bit at a time and feel free to walk away for a bit when you are stuck, or shout out for support on Slack.  

We'll let you get started...
