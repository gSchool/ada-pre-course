### TODO - Video on Terminal

As web developers we regularly use the terminal to run, edit, test and debug our applications.  As such it's important to get familiar with using the MacOS terminal. 

To launch terminal hit `cmd-spacebar` and then type terminal.  You can also add the terminal application to your dock, by right-clicking on the application.
